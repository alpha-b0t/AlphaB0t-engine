## High-Level Architecture
Essentially, the high-level architecture consists of four parts: a bot or automonous agent that executes the strategy it is given through the exchange it it connected to in the context of the mode the bot is assigned to, the strategy, the exchange, and the bot mode. To put it bluntly, one can swap out different bot modes, strategies, and exchanges for the bot.

To run the application locally, run the following command in your terminal:
```
flask --app app run --debug
```

To compile C++ code to the C++17 standard, run the following command in your terminal:
```
make
```
The compiled C++ code will go in the bin folder.

To clear the compiled C++ code, run the following command in your terminal:
```
make clean
```

To run the C++ code (i.e. run `main()` in main.cpp), run the following command in your terminal:
```
make run-main
```

To run the Python unit tests implemented in pytest, run the following command in your terminal:
```
pytest
```
